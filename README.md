# testGit (hello-world repository)
## Purpose
### Testing
The main real purpose of this GitHub repository is to test out the various aspects of this program.
### Roleplay
In this repository I have had dialogues with myself to simulate a real conversation between other contributors, since I have no programmer friends.
## Fun
It is pretty fun. :)
## This fix
This feature that i'm typing now has been requested from a user (me) through the issues section.
There is now a second thing that i'm trying to say, but i'm just not able to do so.
